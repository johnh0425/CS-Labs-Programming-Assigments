Implement a doubly-linked list with dummy head and tail nodes to store integer values. Unlike singly-linked list which only allows forward navigation, a doubly-linked list allows you to navigate the list in both forward and backward directions. A node in a doubly-linked list stores two pointers, prev and next. prev points to the previous node in the list and next points to the next node in the list. The header file (IntList.h) should declare and implement the IntNode struct (just copy it exactly as it is below) as well as the IntList Class interface only. You are also required to come up with a separate implementation file (IntList.cpp) that implements the member functions of the IntList class.
