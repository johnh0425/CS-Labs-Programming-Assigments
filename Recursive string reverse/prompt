Implement the following global function using a recursive algorithm to reverse the contents of a string passed in by reference.

void flipString(string &s);
You may not use a loop of any kind.
You may not use global variables.
You may not use the word reverse anywhere within your main.cpp file.

If any of these are found within your main.cpp file, you will receive a 0 on this lab.

Use the following main function to test your reverse function:

int main() {
   string line;
   cout << "Enter a sentence:" << endl;
   getline(cin, line);
   cout << endl;
   cout << line << endl;
   flipString(line);
   cout << line << endl;

   return 0;
}
